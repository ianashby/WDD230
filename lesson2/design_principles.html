                This website's design clearly illustrates Hick's Law &mdash; the idea that the time it takes to
                make a decision increases with the complexity of choices. As we can see, there is not much going on
                within this homepage's view. First, we notice what the site is about, then we have two options: (1)
                download the report, or (2) scroll down. This user-interface creates a simple and effective way to interact
                with the site.

            <h2>Rule of Thirds</h2>
            <h3><a href="https://www.zendaya.com">Zendaya's Portfolio</a></h3>
            <img src="images/zendaya.png" alt="Screenshot of Zendaya's portfolio and homepage to illustrate good design">
            <p>
                In design and composition, the rule of thirds is a gold standard. When I was taught it in photography, I was
                taught that, when composing with a person, their eyes should rest on the first horizontal thirds line. As we can see
                on Zendaya's portfolio, her eyes and the bottom on the header text rest right on that line. This creates a website that
                is visually appealing and utilizes good design practice.

            <h3><a href="https://www.vanmoof.com/en-US/s5">Vanmoof</a></h3>
            <img src="images/vanmoof.png" alt="Screenshot of Vanmoof's homepage to illustrate good design">
            <p>
                Clean design and ample use of white space are very apparent on Vanmoof's website for their upcoming e-bike. 
                The content of the webpage is simple, effective, and well layed-out. I am not overwhelmed with content, and I can
                clearly see everything that Vanmoof wants me to see. Creating a minimal, clutter-free page is can effectively convey the 
                intent and function of a page.
